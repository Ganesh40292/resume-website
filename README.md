⭐ Project Description

This portfolio website is built as part of my Web Technology laboratory assignment.
It consists of a Home page, Resume page, and Bio-data page — all visually clean and fully responsive.

The website uses subtle animations, a dark/light theme, gradient background movement, and card layouts to ensure a modern, professional look.

🎞️ Animations Used in the Website

This section describes all animations added to the project — formatted beautifully for academic submission and GitHub documentation.

🌈 1. Animated Gradient Background

A continuous multi-color gradient animation runs across the entire website.

Adds depth and life to the UI

Makes the website visually appealing

Smooth and slow transition to avoid distraction

Technology used: CSS @keyframes animation

⌨️ 2. Typewriter Text Animation

A welcoming introduction is animated letter-by-letter.

Enhances user engagement

Gives a dynamic first impression

Created using JavaScript timing function setTimeout()

The animation automatically runs on page load.

🔘 3. Button Hover Scale Animation

All buttons scale up slightly when hovered.

Feels interactive and smooth

Improves user experience

Uses CSS transition & transform: scale()

This small animation contributes greatly to the modern feel of the site.

🖼️ 4. Image Frame Animation (Smooth Fit)

The profile image is displayed inside a rectangle frame with no stretching.

Uses object-fit: contain

Ensures perfect aspect ratio

Gives a clean professional appearance

Not a motion animation, but a visual enhancement technique.

🧩 5. Card Reveal & Smooth Fade Layout

Cards (About Me, Skills, etc.) appear neatly within the layout.

Smooth transitions with padding & layout spacing

Clean shadow + rounded corners for modern design

This creates a soft UI/UX experience.

🌗 6. Dark / Light Mode Transition Animation

Switching themes smoothly fades between color palettes.

Text, buttons, and background update elegantly

Uses CSS transitions

JavaScript toggles .light mode

Enhances readability and accessibility.
