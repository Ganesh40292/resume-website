⭐ Project Description

This project is a modern and responsive Portfolio Website created for my Web Technology Laboratory assignment.
It includes three main pages — Home, Resume, and Bio-data — each designed with simplicity, clarity, and a professional look in mind.

The website demonstrates:

Clean UI/UX design

CSS animations

Card layouts

Interactive theme toggle

Typewriter introduction

Smooth responsive design

🎞️ Animations Used in the Website

🌈 1. Animated Gradient Background

A continuous, smooth multi-color gradient animation runs across the site.
It enhances visual appeal without affecting readability.

⌨️ 2. Typewriter Welcome Animation

A JavaScript-based animation that types text letter-by-letter to greet visitors dynamically.

🔘 3. Button Hover Animation

Buttons grow slightly on hover using transform: scale() and smooth transitions.

🖼️ 4. Rectangle Photo Frame (No Distortion)

The profile image is contained perfectly using object-fit: contain, ensuring no stretching.

🧩 5. Card Layout Appearance

Cards with rounded corners and soft shadows create clean visual separation of content.

🌗 6. Theme Toggle Animation

Switching between light and dark modes smoothly transitions colors across the interface.
