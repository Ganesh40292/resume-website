⭐ Project Description

This project is a clean, modern, and responsive Portfolio Website built as part of my Web Technology Laboratory assignment.
It includes three main web pages — Home, Resume, and Bio-data, each professionally designed using card layouts, animations, and user-friendly navigation.

The website demonstrates:

Frontend development skills

Clean UI/UX design

Basic JavaScript interactivity

Dark/Light theming

Online hosting with GitHub Pages

<br>
🎞️ Animations Included in the Website

Below is a detailed explanation of all animations used, written professionally for academic submission and GitHub documentation.

<br>
🌈 1. Animated Gradient Background

A smooth, multi-color gradient animation runs across the entire site.
It adds life, depth, and modern feel to the UI without distracting the user.

Tech Used: CSS @keyframes + animated gradient positions.
<br>

⌨️ 2. Typewriter Text Animation

The Home page starts with a typewriter-style welcome message.
This animation:

Engages the viewer

Tech Used: JavaScript + setTimeout().
<br>

🔘 3. Button Hover Animation

All buttons scale up and animate smoothly when hovered.
This creates a pleasant, interactive experience.

<br>

🖼️ 4. Smooth Image Fit (Photo Frame Effect)

The profile image is placed inside a clean rectangular frame with:

No stretching

No distortion

Perfect aspect ratio

<br>

🧩 5. Card Layout Design

Cards appear as clean, rounded rectangles with soft edges and spacing.
They improve readability and structure across all pages.
